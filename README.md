## Twitterᴾˡᵘˢ
Enhance the X(Twitter) user experience by loading images in their original quality and removing ads and spam tweets.

#### The main features
* Load images in original quality.
  * copying the image url or saved from the right-click menu both used the original quality.
* ~~Allow download video from tweets. (must be in the tweets of the video)~~
  * Due to the instability of the video download service, this feature has been removed.
* Remove tweets that contain specific hashtags or exceed the maximum limit. (default allow 20 hashtag)
* Remove official ads tweets.
